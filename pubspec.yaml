# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  #  - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #  - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  assets:
  - assets/butt_press.wav
  - assets/beep.mp3
  - images/anon.png
  - images/logo.png
  - images/onboarding/pos.png
  - images/onboarding/inventory.png
  - images/onboarding/cloud.png

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700

  fonts:
    - family: Lato
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Lato-Regular.ttf
        - asset: fonts/Lato-Italic.ttf
          style: italic
        - asset: fonts/Lato-Bold.ttf
          weight: 600
        - asset: fonts/Lato-Black.ttf
          weight: 800
    - family: FlamanteRoma
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Flamante-Roma-Medium.ttf
        - asset: fonts/Flamante-Roma-MediumItalic.ttf
          style: italic
